Use arrows to check where the numerator and denominator go as x approaches 4 from the left. They go to -1 and 0, respectively. The denominator, however, goes to 0 from the left side. Therefore, overall the limit fails to exist but we specify positive infinity. <br>

Please be careful not to 'plug in'. <br>
Please use limit signs and equal signs until x  disappears or you have found the limit.


<br><br>

P2<br>
Check the numerator and denominator using arrows (i.e. do not plug in on paper). We get 0 over 0, so we multiply by the conjugate. Further simplification leads a limit value of 0. <br>

False. It is possible to find two such functions. Give an example for full credit.

a) No, we cannot conclude anything because the limit does not depend on the y-value at the point of interest. <br>
b) No, we cannot conclude anything about the y-value because it does not help determine the value of the limit. In fact, the y-value does not even need to exist. <br><br>
