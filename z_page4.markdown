# course description

<i> AP Computer Science A is both a college-prep course for potential computer science majors and a foundation course for students planning to study in other technical fields such as engineering, physics, chemistry, and geology. The course emphasizes methodology, procedural abstraction, and in-depth study of algorithms, data structures, and data abstractions, as well as a detailed examination of a large case study program. Instruction includes preparation for the AP Computer Science A exam. In this course, students apply the programming tools they have learned to real-life examples on their own. Computer science is more than just programming; students who successfully complete the course will have an understanding of Java and the ability to adapt to any new programming language that they are taught in college. </i>

# attendance

If you must be absent and you know ahead of time, then let me know and I will try to refer you to the topic to be covered that day. You are responsible for obtaining missed notes and other class details from your classmates. Given the pace of the curriculum, I must inform you that one missed class meeting can have a big impact on your progress in this course.

# smart devices policy

All smart phones/watches should be stored in the school bag and on mute/vibrate.

# language

Unless there is a need to interpret an unfamiliar term or phrase, all conversations in the classroom space shall be held in English.

# calculator policy

TI-83/84/89/NSPIRE are recommended graphing calculator models. The in-class demonstrations will focus on the TI-84 features. Be sure to check the calculator policy on the college board website at <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/exam-policies-guidelines/calculator-policies" target="_blank">this link</a>.
