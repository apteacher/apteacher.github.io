# course description

<i>Multivariable Calculus extends differential and integral calculus concepts to functions in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces. The topics include vectors, dot products, cross products, equations of lines and planes, equations of surfaces; vector-valued functions, derivatives and integrals of vector-valued functions, basics of space curves, arclength and curvature; functions of several variables, partial derivatives, tangent planes, chain rule, directional derivatives, the gradient vector, maxima and minima, saddle points, Lagrange multipliers; double integrals in Cartesian and polar coordinates, triple integrals in cylindrical and spherical coordinates. Depending on student interest, the curriculum may include advanced calculus concepts such as vector fields, line integrals, and applications from a wide variety of scientific disciplines or content from logic, proof methods, set theory, and relations. </i>

# calculator policy

TI-83/84/89/NSPIRE are recommended graphing calculator models. The in-class demonstrations will focus on the TI-84 features. Be sure to check the calculator policy on the college board website at <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/exam-policies-guidelines/calculator-policies" target="_blank">this link</a>. In addition to the graphing calculator, we will also use a few CAS applications, so be sure to bring your laptop to class daily.
