  AP Calculus AB follows the curriculum set forth by the College Board. It is worth the equivalent of one semester of college credit upon successful completion of the AP examination offered in May. Students enrolled in this course are required to take this test. Topics covered include library of functions, limits, the derivative, applications of the derivative, definite and indefinite integrals, applications of integration, etc.

P1. <br>
First draw the graph of the function \( f(x) =e^{3x} \). This will help us understand the problem.  <br>
Suppose the tangent line that passes through the origin touches the curve at \( x = a  \) <br>
Find slope after evaluating the derivative: \( f'(x)=3e^{3x} \rightarrow f'(a) = 3e^{3a} \) <br>
The slope is also equal to the slope of the segment connecting the origin to the point on the curve: \( \frac{e^{3a}-0}{a-0} = \frac{e^3a}{a} \) <br>
Set the two versions of slope equal to each other, and then solve to find: \( a=\frac{1}{3} \) <br>
The point on the curve is: \( (\frac{1}{3}, e) \). <br><br>
	
P2. <br>
\( f(x) = x^{1/5}, a=32, b=33 \rightarrow f'(x)=\frac{1}{5} x^{-4/5}  \) <br><br>
 \( L(x) = f(32 + f'(32) (x-32) \rightarrow L(x) = 2 + \frac{1}{80}(x-32) \)<br>
Plugging in \( x = b = 33 \), we get:
\( \sqrt[5]{33} \approxeq L(33) = \frac{161}{80} \)

<b> November 29, 2023 | About the final exam </b> <br>

Our final exam will be comprehensive and worth 20% of the fall semester grade. The precise exam format is unknown at this time but will likely contain problems that involve multiple problem-solving steps, similar to the quiz questions. The exam may also include multiple choice and true/false/justify questions to test our conceptual understanding.
The best way to review is by going over previous homeworks and quizzes (on the course portal reset the assignment filter to a specific date range).
<br>
The list of topics below is general and not meant to include every single idea we discussed in class:<br>
-library of functions - precalculus<br>
-limits conceptually: one-sided and overall<br>
-finding limits algebraically, graphically, and numerically<br>
-laws of limits<br>
-special trig limits<br>
-intermediate value theorem<br>
-squeeze theorem<br>
-slope at a point: two limit definitions of f'(a) <br>
-slope as a rule: limit definition of f'(x)<br>
-rules of differentiation (shortcuts)<br>
-the chain rule<br>
-implicit differentiation<br>
-related rates problems<br>
-derivatives of: trig, inverse trig, logarithmic, exponential functions<br>
-logarithmic differentiation<br>
-linear approximation<br>
-L'Hospital's Rule <br>
-extrema, id behavior, concavity, ...<br><br>

P1. <br>
No need for a drawing here. Differentiate with respect to time, using the product and chain rules: <br>
\( \frac{dV}{dt} = I \frac{dR}{dt} + R \frac{dI}{dt} \) <br>
Plug in the known rates: \( 3 = 3 * 2 + 4 * \frac{dI}{dt} \rightarrow \frac{dI}{dt} =\frac{-3}{4} \) amperes per second.<br>
When V is 12 volts and R is 4 ohms, the current is decreasing at a rate of 3/4 amperes per second. <br> <br>

P2.<br>
Draw a right triangle so that the hypotenuse connects the airplane to the observer, the angle of elevation is \( \theta \), the side oppositive the angle of elevation is 5, and the adjacent is \( x \).<br>

The "big" equation is: \(  \tan\theta = \frac{5}{x} \) or \( \cot\theta = \frac{x}{5} \) <br>
We can work with either equation. After differentiating the second version of the equation with respect to time, we get: <br>
\( -\csc^2\theta \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{5} \frac{dx}{dt} \) <br>
Then plug in: <br>
\( - \csc^2\theta = -4 , \frac{dx}{dt} = 600 miles/hr   \) to find: \( \frac{d\theta}{dt} = -30 rad/hr \).<br>
Be sure to write a conclusion with the final answer and correct units.

P1. <br>
Make a drawing of the ground level, a fixed point where the telescope is and a plane at an altitude of 5km, somewhere to the right. <br>
If \(\theta \) is the angle of elevation, \( x \) is the adjacent, and 5 km is the side opposite the angle \( \theta \), we have: <br>
\( \tan\theta = \frac{5}{x} \) which can also be written as: \( \cot\theta = \frac{x}{5} \) <br>
After differentiating both sides with respect to time, plug in \( x= \frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{-\pi}{6} \) <br>
The final answer is: \( \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{10\pi}{9} km/min \) <br>
Be sure to include a conclusion with the final answer and correct units <br><br>

P2.<br>
Draw a shoreline, a lighthouse 2000 meters away, and a point on the shoreline that is x meters away from the point on the shore nearest to the lighthouse. <br>
Form a right triangle by making the hypotenuse the segment that connects the lighthouse with the point down the shoreline. The angle \(\theta \) is the angle the beam of light forms with the leg that connects the lighthouse to the nearest point on the shore. <br>
The "big" equation is: \(  \tan\theta = \frac{x}{2000} \) <br>
After differentiating with respect to time, plug in: \( \sec^2\theta = \frac{17}{16} , \frac{d\theta}{dt} = 4\pi  \) to find: \( \frac{dx}{dt} = 8500\pi m/min\).<br>

P1. <br>
Make a drawing of a 6 ft tall person going towards an 18-ft tall streetlight (see below) <br>
x = length of shadow <br>
y = distance from the person to the streetlight <br>
dy/dt = -3 ft/s (since y is getting smaller as the person walks towards the streetlight) <br>
Similar triangles, just like we did in class: <br>

\( \frac{x}{6} = \frac{x+y}{18} \) <br>
Cross multiply, simplify  \(  2x = y \) and then differentiate: \(  2dx/dt = dy/dt \) <br>

\( dx/dt = -3/2 ft/s \) <br>
Conclusion: When the person is 10 ft away from the light, the length of the shadow is decreasing at a rate of 3/2 ft/s. <br>

For part b), the rate of the tip is equal to \( dx/dt + dy/dt = -3/2 - 3 = -9/2 ft/s. \) <br>

Conclusion: When the person is 10 ft away from the light, the tip of the shadow is moving towards the streetlight at a rate of 9/2 ft/s. <br>

Make a diagram of the two ships (see above) <Br>
x = distance traveled by ship A.<br>
y = distance traveled by ship B. <br>
z = distance between the ships. <br>
Equation: \( z^2 = (x+y)^2 + 100^2 \) <br>

Differentiate both sides with respect to time, then plug in: <br>

\( dx/dt=35, dy/dt=25, x=140, y=100 \) to find the unknown rate. As we mentioned twice right before writing the quiz, be sure to write a conclusion.

a) \( \lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{\sin^2 x}{x^2+1} = 0 \) with reasoning: <br>
    The numerator fluctuates between 0 and 1 since the range of the sine function is [-1, 1]. Dividing such a quantity by something that goes to infinity gives zero. <br><br>
	
b) \( \lim_{x\to 0} x^2 \cos(1/x^2) = 0 \) using the Squeeze Theorem. To show work here, confirm that the individual limits are 0 and DNE, and then start with the double inequality: <br>
 \( -1 \leq \cos(1/x^2) \leq 1 \) This is not different from the examples we did in class.<br>
c) \( \lim_{x\to \pi/2^+ } e^{\sec x} = 0 \) with reasoning: the secant function goes to negative infinity because cosine goes to 0 from the negative side. Raising e to an amount that goes to negative infinity gives zero. <br>
d) Rewrite as: \( \lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{\cos x}{e^{2x}} = 0 \) with reasoning: the numerator is bounded between -1 and 1, whereas the denominator goes to infinity. Therefore the quotient goes to zero. <br>
e) \( \lim_{x\to 0^+} \tan^{-1}\ln x = \frac{-\pi}{2} \) with reasoning: the natural log goes to negative infinity; the arctangent function goes to its horizontal asymptote on the left: \(\ -\pi/2 \) <br> <br>

At these two places, the one-sided and right-sided limits do not equal each other, so the overall limit does not exist. <br>

Separate variables and integrate: \( \int \frac{1}{T-75} dT = \int k dt \) <br>
Plugging in the initial condition (t=0, T=350) into the anti-derivatives, we get: <br>
\(\ln|T-75| = kt+C \rightarrow C=\ln 275 \) <br>
Plugging in the new condition (t=5; T=340), we get: <br>
\( \ln 265 = 5k +\ln 275 \rightarrow k\approxeq -0.00740825, C\approxeq 5.61677 \) <br>
Finally, plug in T=300 and solve for t using your calculator, to find \( t\approxeq 27.087 minutes\) <br>

<b> December 9, 2022 | About the final exam </b> <br>
The exam will be comprehensive of all fall semester material and it will carry a weight of 20% towards the overall grade. Your quiz average, which is your current grade in the course, will carry a weight of 80%. <br>
To prepare for the exam, go over previous homework assignments and assessments. The assignments should still be accessible on myCushing by visiting the Assignments tab on your course page. The exam will last a minimum of 90 minutes and a maximum of 120 minutes. The format of the exam will likely be similar to the one for quizzes but there may be some multiple choice questions as well. Calculators may or may not be required so be sure to bring them. On the day of the exam, you should bring your own utensils. The exam is scheduled for Tuesday morning, December 13, 8:30am.  <br> 

To help you identify areas worthy of special focus, here is a list of some of the key topics and ideas we have discussed this semester: pre-requisites (precalculus/geometry), finding limits, continuity, the intermediate value theorem, the squeeze theorem, special trigonometric limits, slope (derivative) as a number, slope(derivative) as a rule, rules of differentiation, the chain rule, implicit differentiation, related rates problems, linear approximation, exponential/logarithmic/inverse trig derivatives, inverse functions, l'hospital's rule, curve sketching process and related concepts, the mean value theorem / rolle's theorem. <br>
 
 Optional Extra Help Sessions: Monday (2:30pm-3:30pm in JRCAC 110;  8:15pm-9:15pm via Zoom <a href="https://cushingacademy.zoom.us/j/294640299?pwd=UVIxdXhlZ0t4UU9OTWx3ZTFFaXBwUT09

P1. <br>
a) <br>
\( 6 + x^3 y =x y^2 \rightarrow 3 x^2 y + x^3 dy/dx = y^2 + 2xy dy/dx \rightarrow dy/dx = \frac{y^2-3x^2y}{x^3-2xy}\) <br>
b) <br>

Plug in \( x=1 \) into the equation of the curve to find: \( (1, 3), (1,-2) \) <br>
At \( (1,3) \) the slope is 0, so the tangent line equation is \( y=3 \)  <br>
At \( (1,-2) \) the slope is 2, so the tangent line equation is \( y=2x-4 \)  <br>
c) <br>
The vertical tangent will occur whenever the denominator of the expression for \( dy/dx \) is zero while the numerator isn't zero. <br>
\( \rightarrow x (x^2-2y) = 0 \rightarrow x=0 \text{ or } y=\frac{x^2}{2} \) <br>
The curve does not intersect the y-axis (why?) so the only possibility is \( y=\frac{x^2}{2} \). <br> Plugging this into the original equation leads to: <br>
\( x= (-24)^{2/5}, y =\frac{(-24)^{2/5}}{2}\) <br>

The graph below shows the curve, the two tangent lines at x=1, and the vertical tangent line:

P1. <br>
a) <br>
\( \lim_{x\to \infty}\frac{\sin^2 x}{x^2+1} \) = 0 <br>
Approach 1: Using words and inequalities -- the numerator does not go anywhere in particular as x go to infinity but as a quantity it stays between 0 and 1. The denominator goes to infinity. Therefore, the ratio goes to 0. We say that the limit is 0. <br>
Approach 2: Squeeze Theorem with x going to infinity. This is more formal. Start with \( 0 \leq \sin^2 x \leq 1 \) and multiply the double inequality by \( \frac{1}{x^2+1}\), to get: \( 0\leq \frac{\sin^2 x}{x^2+1} \leq \frac{1}{x^2+1} \). Be sure to refer to the theorem by name when reaching a conclusion. <br> <br>
b)<br>
\( \lim_{x\to 0} x^2 \cos(\frac{1}{x^2}) = 0 \) <br>
Use the Squeeze Theorem here with the setup: \( -1\leq \cos(\frac{1}{x^2}) \leq1 \).
 <br> <br>
 
c)<br>
 \( \lim_{x\to (\pi/2)^{+}} e^{\sec x} = 0 \) <br>
  Show that since \( \cos x \rightarrow 0^{-} \) it follows that \(\sec x \rightarrow -\infty \). Therefore \( e^{\sec x} \rightarrow 0 \) as \( x \rightarrow (\pi/2)^{+} \), with reasoning.
   <br> <br>
d)<br>
Rewrite the limit as:
 \( \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\cos x}{e^{2x}} = 0 \) <br>

e)<br>
    \( \lim_{x\to 0^{+}} \tan^{-1}(\ln x) \) <br>
 First of all, note that the expression here refers to arctangent (inverse trig) and not the reciprocal of the tangent function. Start with the inside expression: <br>
 
 \( \ln x \rightarrow -\infty \) (vertical asymptote) as approaches 0 from the right. <br>
 \( f(x)=\tan^{-1}x \rightarrow -\frac{\pi}{2} \) (horizontal asymptote). <br>

P2. <br>
-check domain: all non-negative real numbers. <br> 
-state that \( f(x)=\cos\sqrt{x} - e^x+2 \) is continuous on [0, 2] since it is composition and sum/difference of continuous functions in their respective domains. <br>
-refer to and apply the Intermediate Value Theorem: \(f(0) = 2 > 0 \text{ and } f(2) = \cos \sqrt{2}-e^2+2 < 0 \) <br>
-conclude, with the reasoning above, that the function does in fact have at least one zero in the given interval. <br>

Do not try to use a calculator you have not used before. Also, make sure the calculator you bring is approveed by the College Board. <br> <br>

<b> April 4, 2022 | Grades and coursework this semester  </b> <br>
 Hi everyone, <br>
 The coursework for our class unofficially ends the day before the AP Exam (May 8th). Following the AP exam, the general plan is to check-in at the start of class and have a 'study hall' option or participate in other ungraded activities. <br> In other words, there will not be any opportunities for grade improvement after the AP Exam. <br>
As always, let me know if you have any questions.

<b> November 28, 2021 | About the final exam.  </b> <br>
<font color="dodgerblue">  <br>
Hi everyone. I hope you all had a good break. Believe it or not, there are only two weeks of classes before the semester concludes with final exams. For our class, the exam will be comprehensive and will carry a weight of 20%. The rest of the grade (assessments/quizzes) will carry a weight of 80%. As discussed at our very first meeting, there is no final exam in the spring for this class, because the AP Exam is required for all students. Let me know if you have any questions. <br>
