  AP Calculus AB follows the curriculum set forth by the College Board. It is worth the equivalent of one semester of college credit upon successful completion of the AP examination offered in May. Students enrolled in this course are required to take this test. Topics covered include library of functions, limits, the derivative, applications of the derivative, definite and indefinite integrals, applications of integration, etc.

The function is even, it has a horizontal asymptote of \( y = 0 \) at both ends of the picture, is increasing for \( x < 0 \) and decreasing for \( x > 0 \). <br>
The graph is concave down on \( \left( \frac{-\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \) and concave up everywhere else. See inflection points on graph. <br>  <br>

Since we are revolving about the y-axis, the Shell Method is a reasonable choice here. The Washer Method would need to be broken into two integrals and one of them is especially difficult to solve. <br>
\( V_{shell} = \int\limits_1^2 2\pi x e^{-x^2 dx}  \). <br>

  \( f(x) = \arctan(-4x) -\ln(2x)\) at \(x=\frac{1}{4} \)<br>
  \( f(1/4) = \ln 2 - \frac{\pi}{4} \) <br> 
  \( f'(x) = \frac{-4}{1+16x^2} -\frac{1}{x}\) <br>
  The slope of the tangent line is therefore: \( f'(1/4) = -6\) <br>
  The tangent line equation is: \( y = -6x + \frac{3}{2} +\ln 2 -\frac{\pi}{4}\) <br>
  The normal line equation is: \( y = \frac{x}{6} - \frac{1}{24} +\ln 2 -\frac{\pi}{4}\) <br> <br>
  P1. <br>
  The point (1,2) is on the graph of \( g(x) \) because the tangent line touches there. <br>
  Since the slope of the tangent line is 3, that means \( g'(1)= 3\) <br>
  The point (2,1) is on the graph of \( g^{-1}(x) \). <br>
  So we have: \( (g^{-1})'(2) = \frac{1}{g'(g^{-1}(2))} = \frac{1}{g'(1)} = \frac{1}{3} \) <br> 
  The tangent line on \( g^{-1}\) is then: \( y- 1 = \frac{1}{3} (x-2) \) or \( y =\frac{x+1}{3}\). <br><br>

  \( y = \frac{x^3 \sqrt[3]{x^2+7}}{(3-x)^6} \) <br>
  When \( x= 1 \), find \( y=\frac{1}{32} \). <br>
  In order to find the slope of the tangent line, we first take the natural log of both sides: <br>
  \( \ln y = 3 \ln x -\frac{1}{3} \ln(x^2+7) - 6\ln(3-x) \) <br>
  Then we differentiate implictly (i.e. logarithmic differentiation):<br>
  \( \frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \left( \frac{3}{x} +\frac{1}{3} \frac{2x}{x^2+7} - 6 \frac{-1}{3-x} \right) \) <br>
  Plug in \( x=1, y=\frac{1}{32} \) to find \( m = \frac{73}{384}\) <br>
  The equation of the tangent line is: \( y -\frac{1}{32} = \frac{73}{384}(x-1) \) or \( y = \frac{73x-63}{384}\) <br><br>

  When \( a=-1 \), the statement above becomes: \( (f^{-1}(-1))' = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(-1))}\) <br>

  Use precalculus to find \( f^{-1}(-1) \) by setting \(y=1 \) in the original function: \( -1 = \frac{1}{3} (x^5+2x^3) \) <br>
  Rewrite as \( -3 = x^5+ 2x^3 \) and by trial and error confirm that \( x = -1 \), which means \( f^{-1}(-1)= -1\) (A coincidence? Maybe.) <br>

  \( (f^{-1}(-1))' = \frac{1}{f'(-1)} =\frac{1}{\frac{1}{3}(5(-1)^4+6*(-1)^2)} = \frac{3}{5+6} = \frac{3}{11}\)

\( 6 + x^3y = xy^2 \) <br>

a) Differentiate with respect to \(x \). Be sure to use Leibniz notation, as follows. (Do not use \( y'\)!) <br>

\( 0 + 3x^2 y +x^3 \frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 + 2xy \frac{dy}{dx}\) <br>

Find \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x^2y-y^2}{2xy-x^3} \) or \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y^2-3x^2y}{x^3-2xy} \) <br> <br>

b) When \( x = 1 \), the equation of the curve becomes \( 6+y = y^2 \) <br>

Solve the quadratic equation to find two solutions: \(y=3, y=-2\), so the points are \( (1,3) \) and \( (1,-2)\). <br>

At \( (1,3)\), the slope is zero, so the tangent line has equation \( y =3 \). <br>
At \( (1,-2)\), the slope is 2, so the tangent line has equation \( y=2x-4\). <br> <br>

c) The slope must be undefined when the tangent line is vertical, so be sure to set the derivative's denominator equal to zero: <br>
\( 2xy - x^3 = 0 \) <br>
\( x (2y-x^2) = 0 \) <br>
Case 1: \( x = 0\). Plugging this into the original equation gives us 6 = 0, which is an impossibility.<br>
Case 2: \( y = \frac{x^2}{2} \). Plugging this into the original equation gives us \( x =\sqrt[5]{-24}\), which is the equation of the vertical tangent line. <br>

  P1. <br>
  Set \( f(x) = \cos\sqrt{x} - e^x + 2. \) Note that this function is a sum or difference of continuous functions in their respective domains. <br>
  Therefore \( f(x) \) is continuous on the interval [0, 2]. We can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem. (Be sure the mention it by name!). <br>
  \( f(0) = 1 - 1 + 2 = 2 > 0 \) <br>
  \( f(2) \text{ is some negative number because } -e^2 \) is closer to -9. <br>
  Therefore, by IVT, the function has at least one zero in the open interval (0, 2), which is the same as saying the equation has at least one solution in the interval (0,2). <br><br>

  P2. <br>
  a) \( \lim\limits_{x\to\infty} \frac{\sin^2x}{x^2+1} = 0  \) because the numerator ranges from 0 to 1 and the numerator goes to positive infinity. The ratio therefore goes to zero.<br>
  Note 1: do not break this into a quotient of limits. We can only do that when the individual limits exist. In this case, the limit of the numerator is not some finite value. i.e. it does not exist! <br>
  An alternate approach here is to use the Squeeze Theorem. Start with the double inequality: \( 0 \leq \sin^2 x\leq 1 \), then multiply by \( \frac{1}{x^2+1} \). <br> <bR>


  b) <br>
\( \lim\limits_{x\to 0} x^2 \cos\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right) = 0 \) <br>
Be sure to use the Squeeze Theorem here. Mention it by name and show the work. The example is almost identical to what we did in class. <br>

  c) <br>
  \( \lim\limits_{x\to (\pi/2)^+} e^{\sec x} = 0  \) because the secant expression goes towards negative infinity as cosine tends towards 0 from the left side. <br>
  Overall, the limit goes to zero.  If you are still struggling with trigonometric expressions, that's a strong hint that you need to review/relearn the precalculus chapters. We will be seeing A LOT OF trigonometry in this class.

  After factoring completely, start with the domain of the function: \( f(x) = \frac{(x-8)(x+2)}{(x-8)(x+1)\sqrt{(x-2)(x+2)}} \).<br>
  The domain of the function is \( (-\infty, -2) \cup (2, 8) \cup (8, \infty) \), so we should(!) ignore \( x  = -1 \). <br><br>
  The function has an infinite discontinuity (vertical asymptote) at \( x = 2 \) and a removable discontinuity at \( x = 8 \). (FULL CREDIT if you got this far.) <br>
  The function approaches 0 as x goes to -2 from the left. As an exercise, you can confirm this by setting up the one-sided limit. The graph has a hole at \( (-2, 0) \), but because the function is not defined on both sides, this point is neither a jump nor a removable discontinuity. <br>




  A desmos plot of the graph of the function is below: <br>

 a) <br> \( \lim\limits_{t\to \pi/2^+} e^{\tan t} = e^{\lim\limits_{t\to \pi/2^+}\tan t} = e^{-\infty} = 0 \) <br>
 Feel free to support your reasoning either by showing a graph of \( f(t) = \tan t \) or the unit circle. <br>

 b) <br> \( \lim\limits_{\theta\to 0} \left( \frac{1-\cos\theta} {\theta}\right) = \lim\limits_{\theta\to 0} (-1) \left( \frac{\cos\theta - 1} {\theta}\right) = (-1) * 0 = 0 \) <br>
  Optionally, after checking that the limit form is \( \frac{0}{0} \) (use arrows!), multiply both top and bottom by the conjugate of the numerator: \( (1+\cos\theta) \), and then simplify using the fundamental trig identity and the fact that \( \lim\limits_{\theta \to 0} \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} = 1 \) <br>
 <br>
 c) <br>
 Check that the form is 0 over 0 (using arrows), then manipulate the limit as follows: <br>
 \( \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{3x - \sin(kx)}{x} =\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{3x}{x} - \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin(kx)}{x} = 3 - k \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin(kx)}{kx} = 3 - k*1 = 3 - k  \).

Hi everyone. Today's quiz went well on average. <br>
General comments: <br>
Check where "things go" and use arrows to show it.<br>
Use limit signs. <br>
Use equal signs. <br>
Do not use equal signs between the limit sign and the expression. <br> <br>

Specific issues: <br>
The only problem that presented a challenge of sorts was \( \lim\limits_{x\to1} \frac{x^3-1}{x^2-1} \) <br>
After checking that both numerator and denominator go to zero, use the difference of squares for the bottom and the difference of cubes formula for the top.<br>
\( A^3 - B^3 = (A-B)(A^2 + AB + B^2) \) <br>
\( \lim\limits_{x\to1} \frac{x^3-1}{x^2-1} = \lim\limits_{x\to1} \frac{(x-1)(x^2+x+1)}{(x-1)(x+1)} =  \lim\limits_{x\to1} \frac{x^2+x+1}{x+1} = \frac{3}{2} \)

The domain of the function \( f(x) = \log(x^2-1) \) can be determined by setting \( x^2 - 1 > 0  \). This expression holds true whenever \( x < - 1 \text{ or } x > 1 \). <br>
Using interval notation, the domain is \( (-\infty, -1) \cup (1, \infty) \). <br><br>
P2. <br>
This was similar to the problems we did in class. Combine into a single logarithm: <br>
\( \log_{2}((x+2)(x-1)) = 2 \) <br>
Solve the quadratic equation to find : \( x=-3, x = 2 \). Of these, only \( x=2  \) is in the domain. <br><br>

a) \( f(x) = \sqrt{(1-x)(x+3)} \rightarrow (1-x)(x+3) \geq 0  \) <br>
Solve graphically or algebraically or on the number line with test points, to conclude that the domain is: \( [-3, 1] \) <br>
b) \( g(x) = \sqrt{-x-2} \rightarrow -x-2 \geq 0 \). The domain is: \( (-\infty, -2] \) <br>
c) The domain of \( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) \) is the intersection of the two domains above, which is \( [-3, -2] \).
<br>
P2.<br>
a) The function \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1-x^2} \) is odd because: \( f(-x) = \frac{-x}{1-(-x)^2} = - \frac{x}{1-x^2} = -f(x) \). <br>
Note that you could also test specific values here but the steps above are more convincing.  <br>
b) Similar to the first problem, we can form a function such as: \( f(x) = \sqrt{(1-x)(x-5)}\). There are other examples that work, too.

The slope field for \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1-x}{y} \) was okay, except along the horizontal axis (y=0) be sure to draw vertical line to indicate that the slope is undefined there. <br>
The typical solution should pass through the initial point (1,1). After separating variables:<br>
\( \int y dy = \int (1-x) dx  \) <br>
\( \frac{y^2}{2} = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + C\) (do not forget the integration constant). <br>
Plug in (1,1) to find C=0, then solve for y: <br>
\( y^2 = 2x-x^2  \) <br>
\( y = \pm \sqrt{2x-x^2} \). Conclude that the because the point (1,1) is part of the solution, we pick the positive root option: <br>
\( y = \sqrt{2x-x^2} \)
<br><br>

P2.<br>
Separate variables: <br>
\( \int \frac{1}{T-75} dT = \int k dt \) <br>
Integrate both sides and add the integration constant: <br>
\( \ln |T-75| = kt + C \)  (Note the required use of the absolute value.)<br>
Plug in \( t=0, T = 350 \) to find \( C = \ln 275 \approxeq 5.61677 \) <br>
Plug in \( t=5, T = 340 \) to find \( k = \frac{\ln 265 - \ln 275}{5} \approxeq -0.0074 \) <br> <br>

The problem did not ask for the general solution, but if you must state the solution, be sure to write: <br>
\( |T-75| = e^C e^{kt} \) <br>
\( T - 75 = \pm e^C e^{kt}\) <br> 
\( T(t) = 75 \pm e^C e^{kt} \) <br> 
And then choose the positive option because the temperatures we are looking at are clearly more than 75 degrees.<br> <br>

To find the time it takes for the temperature to "cool" to 300 degrees, plug in T = 300: <br>

\( \ln 225 = kt + \ln 275 \rightarrow t^{*} = \frac{\ln 225 - \ln 275}{k} \approxeq 27.087 \text{minutes} \).

a) \( f'(x)= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{3/(1-(x+h))-3/(1-x)}{h} =\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{3}{h} ( \frac{1}{1-x-h}-\frac{1}{1-x}) \) <br>

  \( f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{3}{h} ( \frac{(1-x)-(1-x-h)}{(1-x-h)(1-x)} ) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{3}{h} ( \frac{h}{(1-x-h)(1-x)} ) = ...= \frac{3}{(1-x)^2}   \) <br>
  
b) To find the equation of the tangent line at x = -2, find slope: \( f'(-2) = 1/3 \) and the y-coordinate: \( f(-2) = 1 \), then <br>

 set up the equation: \( y - 1 = (1/3) (x+2) \), which simplifies to: \( y = \frac{x+5}{3} \)

P1<br>
a) \( \lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{\sin^2 x}{x^2+1} = 0 \) with reasoning: <br>
    The numerator fluctuates between 0 and 1 since the range of the sine function is [-1, 1]. Dividing such a quantity by something that goes to infinity gives zero. <br><br>
	
b) \( \lim_{x\to 0} x^2 \cos(1/x^2) = 0 \) using the Squeeze Theorem. To show work here, confirm that the individual limits are 0 and DNE, and then start with the double inequality: <br>
 \( -1 \leq \cos(1/x^2) \leq 1 \) This is not different from the examples we did in class.<br>
c) \( \lim_{x\to \pi/2^+ } e^{\sec x} = 0 \) with reasoning: the secant function goes to negative infinity because cosine goes to 0 from the negative side. Raising e to an amount that goes to negative infinity gives zero. <br>
d) Rewrite as: \( \lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{\cos x}{e^{2x}} = 0 \) with reasoning: the numerator is bounded between -1 and 1, whereas the denominator goes to infinity. Therefore the quotient goes to zero. <br>
e) \( \lim_{x\to 0^+} \tan^{-1}\ln x = \frac{-\pi}{2} \) with reasoning: the natural log goes to negative infinity; the arctangent function goes to its horizontal asymptote on the left: \(\ -\pi/2 \) <br> <br>
