<b> November 28, 2021 | About the final exam.  </b> <br>
<font color="dodgerblue">  <br>
Hi everyone. I hope you all had a good break. Believe it or not, there are only two weeks of classes before the semester concludes with final exams. For our class, the exam will be comprehensive and will carry a weight of 20%. The rest of the grade (assessments/quizzes) will carry a weight of 80%. As discussed at our very first meeting, there is no final exam in the spring for this class, because the AP Exam is required for all students. Let me know if you have any questions. <br>

a) 
|x| = -x when x is near -2 (why?), so the limit becomes: <br>
\( \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{2-(-x)}{2+x} = \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{2+x}{2+x} = 1 \) <br>

b) As x approaches 0.5 from the left, note that 2x-1 is a negative number, so |2x-1| = -(2x-1). The limit becomes: <br>
\( ) \lim_{x \to 0.5^{-}} \frac{2x-1}{x^2 |2x-1|} =  \lim_{x \to 0.5^{-}} \frac{2x-1)}{-x^2 (2x-1)} = \text{...} = -4 \) <br>
 
c) Simplify the expression (common denominator). The limit is -1/9.

<br><br>

P2<br>

Factor the bottom to find (x+1)(x+2). In order for the limit to exist, by the factor theorem, x=-2, must make the numerator zero as well. Find a = 15, and then evaluate the limit to -1.

Study the one-sided limits separately by using the two cases for the absolute value expression. The one sided limits turn out to be 5 and -5. Conclude this problem with a neat sketch that consists of two half lines that do not connect.
