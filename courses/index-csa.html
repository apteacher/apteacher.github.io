  <p>AP Computer Science A is both a college-prep course for potential computer science majors and a foundation course for students planning to study in other technical fields such as engineering, physics, chemistry, and geology. The course emphasizes methodology, procedural abstraction, and in-depth study of algorithms, data structures, and data abstractions, as well as a detailed examination of a large case study program. Instruction includes preparation for the AP Computer Science A exam. In this course, students apply the programming tools they have learned to real-life examples on their own. Computer science is more than just programming; students who successfully complete the course will have an understanding of Java and the ability to adapt to any new programming language that they are taught in college.

 <b> September 17, 2022 | About grades and the myCushing gradebook </b> <br>
   The current grade on myCushing is updated approximately once a week (usually by Sunday night) and it is a simple average of all the assessment scores you have earned to date in my class. The 'current_grade' assignment is not really an assignment but just a way to keep you informed about your present average. For example, as of Saturday, September 17, what you see on myCushing is current. <br>
   
   The gradebook does not have individual quiz/assessment scores as those are kept separately. As always, if you have questions or if you think your grade for some reason looks wrong, don't hesitate to reach out.

 For our class, the weekly update will reflect your current grade, including any graded week from the week before.
