  AP Calculus BC follows the curriculum set forth by the College Board. It is worth the equivalent of two semesters of college credit upon successful completion of the AP examination in May. Students enrolled in this course are required to take this test. Topics covered include library of functions, limits, the derivative, applications of the derivative, definite and indefinite integrals, applications of integration, techniques of integration, infinite series and sequences, etc.

 a) \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n (n+1)3^n}{ 2^{2n+1}} \) <br>
 The Ratio Test works best here. Be sure to use the absolute value notation: <br>

 \( |\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| = |\frac{(n+2)3^{n+1}}{2^{2n+3}} * \frac{2^{2n+1}}{(n+1)3^n}| = ... |\frac{n+2}{n+1} \frac{3}{4}|\rightarrow \frac{3}{4} < 1 \) <br>
 Since the series converges absolutely, it convergs. <br> <br>

 b) \( \sum_{n=1} (-1)^n \frac{\sqrt{n}}{2n+1} \) <br>
 Use the alternating series test  here. We need to check and show work for two conditions: <br>
 First, \( b_n = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{2n+1} = \frac{1/\sqrt{n}}{2+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}} \rightarrow \frac{0}{2+0} = 0 \) <br>
 Second, confirm that \( b_{n+1} \leq b_n\). You can do this algebraically or by taking the derivative of \( f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{2x+1}\) and confirming that the derivative is negative. <br>

 c) \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\cos 3n}{1+(1.2)^n} \) <br>
 This is similar to the example from class. We show absolute convergence for the given series by using the comparison test twice: <br>
 \( | \frac{\cos 3n}{1+(1.2)^n} | \leq \frac{1}{1+(1.2)^n} < \frac{1}{(1.2)^n} = (5/6)^n \) <br>
 The right-most sequence above makes a geometric series that is convergent, so by the Comparison Test, the original series converges absolutely, and therefore it converges. <br>

 d) \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-5)^{2n}}{n^2 9^n} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{5^{2n}}{n^2 9^n}  \) <br>
 Use the ratio test with care to show that the series diverges. Note that: \( a_{n+1} = \frac{5^{2(n+1)}}{(n+1)^2 9^{n+1} }\). The ratio ends up approaching 25/9, which is greater than 1. <br>

  <b> April 4, 2024 | Thoughts on problem 15 from today's worksheet.</b> <br>
 
  An odd number can be described as \( 2n-1 \) or \( 2n+1 \) if n is a positive integer. <br> 
   In the absence of a formula for the product of the odd numbers, we write: <br>
   \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1*3*...*(2n-1)}{n!} \) <br>
   Proceed to test using the Ratio Test:
   \( |\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| = | \frac{1*3*...*(2n-1)(2n+1)}{(n+1)*n!} \frac{n!}{1*3*...*(2n-1)}| = |\frac{2n+1}{n+1}|\rightarrow 2 > 1  \) <br>
   Therefore the series diverges.

  <b> March 29, 2024 | Thoughts on recent quiz </b> <br>
  P1. <br>
  a) True. All sequences are functions because for every n in the domain there is exactly one term of the sequence. <br>
  b) False. Consider \( a_n=(-1)^n, b_n = (-1)^{n+1} \). The sequence \( \{a_n + b_n\} \) converges to 0 even though the individual sequences diverge. <br>
  c) False. Consider \( \{(-1)^n \}_{n=1}^{\infty} \). <br>
  d) True. The y-value of the horizontal asymptote is also where the sequences converges. <br> <br>

  P2.<br>
  a) This is geometric sequence with \( r=\frac{\pi}{4} \). Since \( -1 < r  \leq 1 \), the sequence converges. In this case it converges to 0. <br>
  b) The positive part of the sequence converges to 2. Therefore the sequences oscillates between approximately 2 and approximately -2. The sequence therefore diverges. <br>
  c) The natural log goes to infinity. The outer function (arctangent) goes towards \( \pi/2 \), therefore the sequence converges to \( \pi/2 \). <br>

  When \( x = -a \rightarrow \theta = -\pi/2\). When \( x=a \rightarrow \theta = \pi/2 \).
  Be sure to update the bounds of integration whenever you switch variables: <Br>

  \( A=1/12, B = -1/12, C=-1/3 \) <br>

\( x = \sec \theta \rightarrow dx = \sec \theta \tan \theta d\theta; x^2 = \sec^2 \theta \) <br>

\( \int_3^5 \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{x^2-1}} dx = \int_a^b \frac{\sec^2\theta}{\tan\theta} \sec \theta \tan \theta d\theta   \) <br>

The distance function of the boat going east towards the same dock is \( y(t) = 15-15t \), because at the beginning (t=0) this boat is located 15 km away and its velocity is negative since it is approaching the dock. <br>
Set up the square of the distance as the objective function: \( Q(t) = (x(t))^2 + (y(t))^2 = 225 (1-t)^2 + 400t^2 \) <br>

  The dimension of the paper with least area are: \( 3\sqrt{7} + 3  \) by \( 2\sqrt{7} + 2 \) <br>
To justify, use the First Derivative Test for Global Extrema. Note that the numerator of the factored version of the derivative is a quadratic expression. Its graph is a parabola that opens up and changes from negative to positive at the critical number. This implies that the original function has a global minimum at \(x = 3\sqrt{7} \). <br> 
The Second Derivative Test for Global Extrema works as well. No matter which test you use, be sure to explain! <br>

Our final exam will be comprehensive and worth 20% of the fall semester grade. Your pre-exam grade therefore will carry a weight of 80%. The precise exam format is unknown at this time but will likely contain problems that involve multiple problem-solving steps, similar to the quiz questions. The exam may also include multiple choice and true/false/justify questions to test our conceptual understanding.
The best way to review is by going over previous homeworks and quizzes (on the course portal reset the assignment filter to a specific date range).

The list of topics below is general and not meant to include every single idea we discussed in class:<br>
-library of functions - precalculus<br>
-limits conceptually: one-sided and overall<br>
-finding limits algebraically, graphically, and numerically<br>
-laws of limits<br>
-special trig limits<br>
-intermediate value theorem<br>
-squeeze theorem<br>
-slope at a point: two limit definitions of f'(a) <br>
-slope as a rule: limit definition of f'(x)<br>
-rules of differentiation (shortcuts)<br>
-the chain rule<br>
-implicit differentiation<br>
-related rates problems<br>
-derivatives of: trig, inverse trig, logarithmic, exponential functions<br>
-logarithmic differentiation<br>

  Find slope after evaluating the derivative: \( f'(x)=3e^{3x} \rightarrow f'(a) = 3e^{3a} \) <br>

  Be sure to use show work and use the limit signs vs arrows vs equal signs appropriately. <br>
  Apply the Ratio Test as follows: <br>
  \( |\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| =|\frac{(x-2)^{n+1} 3^n n^2}{(x-2)^n 3^{n+1}(n+1)^2}| = \frac{|x-2|}{3} \frac{n^2}{(n+1)^2} \rightarrow 
  \frac{|x-2|}{3} < 1 \) <br>
  The radius of convergence is 3. Be sure to test the endpoints x=-1 and x=5. The series converges at both endpoints (give reason), so the interval of convergence is [-1, 5].

  Be sure to use show work and use the limit signs vs arrows vs equal signs appropriately. <br>
  \( f(x) = \frac{x}{2x^2+1} = x \frac{1}{1-(-2x^2)} \) <br>
  Use the geometric series representations (like we did in class), to represent the given function as: <br>
  \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-2x^2)^n =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n 2^n x^{2n+1}  \) <br>
  This representation is valid whenever \( |-2x^2| < 1 \), which means \( -1/\sqrt{2} < x < 1/\sqrt{2} \) <br>
  For the interval of convergence, be sure to test the endpoints. In this case, the series diverges at both endpoints by the Test for Divergence (show work!), so the interval of convergence is: \( (-1/\sqrt{2}, 1/\sqrt{2}) \) <br>

  a) <br>
  \( a_n = \tan^{-1}(n^2) \) converges to \( \pi/2 \) since the arctangent approaches this values as \( n^2 \to \infty \)<br><br>
  
  b) <br>
  \( a_n = (2n)^{1/n} - n^{1/n} = (2^{1/n}-1) n^{1/n} \) converges to 0 with work shown: set \( y = n^{1/n}, \ln(y) = \ln(n)/n \to 0 \) by L'Hospital's Rule, so \( y \to 1\). On the other hand, \(2^{1/n} - 1 \to 1-1 = 0 \), so the overall sequence converges to 1 * 0 = 0. <br><br>
  
  c) <br>
  \( a_n = \frac{\ln(n^2)}{\ln(2n)}= \frac{2\ln(n)}{\ln(n)+\ln(n)} = \frac{2}{\frac{\ln(2)}{\ln(n)} +\frac{\ln(n)}{\ln(n)}} \rightarrow 2/1 = 2 \)<br><br>
  
  d) <br>
  \( y= a_n = (1-2/n)^n \) converges to \( e^{-2} \). Write \( \ln y = n \ln(1-2/n) \), then use L'Hospital's Rule.<br><br>
  
  e) <br>
  \( a_n =\ln(\frac{n+2}{n^2-3}) \) approaches negative infinity since the fraction goes to 0 from the positive side. <br><br>

  No issues with this problem except when differentiating with respect to time t, remember that the derivative of a constant is zero. <br>
  If x is the distance from the light source to the person and y is the length of the shadow, one version of the equation is: \( \frac{x}{2} =\frac{12}{y} \) <br>
  Rewrite as: \( x y = 24 \), then implicitly differentiate to find the unknown rate. <br>
  Again, remember to write a sentence at the end. <br> <br>
   
  P2 <br>
  The equation is simple here but the numbers are a bit messy because the units need to be converted. <br>
  Let x be the distance covered by the person going north. After 20 minutes: x = 20 * 60 * 4 = 4800 feet. <br>
  Let y be the distance covered by the person going south. After 15 minutes: y = 15 * 60 * 5 = 4500 feet. <br>
  Calculate z using:  \( (x+y)^2 + 500^2 = z^2 \) <br>
  \( 9300^2 + 500^2 = z^2 \rightarrow 100^2 (93^2 + 5^2) = z^2 \rightarrow z = 100 \sqrt{8374}  \)
  Calculate the unknown rate using the formula below. Be sure to include a sentence and units. <br>

  a) <br>
  \( \lim_{x\to -2}\frac{2-|x|}{2+x} \) <br>
  -Because x is going to -2 and hence is less than zero, \( |x| = -x \) for both one-sided limits. <br>
  -The overall limit comes out to 1, after confirming both sides. <br><br>
  b) <br>
  \( \lim_{x \to 0.5^{-}}\frac{2x-1}{x^2 |2x-1|} \) <br>

  -simplify but keep writing the limit notation. <br>
  -the limit comes out to -1/9.<br> <br>
  P2. <br>
  The denominator goes to 0 as x approach -2, so the numerator must go towards 0. From precalculus, the factor theorem suggests that (x+2) has to be a factor of both. Plugging x=-2 into the numerator and making it equal to 0, find a = 15. Then find the limit by factoring the numerator:
  \(\lim_{x\to -2} \frac{3 (x+2) (x+3)}{(x+2)(x-1)} =... = -1 \)

  \lim_{x\to 2^{-}}\frac{(x+3)(x-2)}{|x-2|}=\lim_{x\to 2^{+}}\frac{(x+3)(x-2)}{2-x}= \lim_{x\to 2^{+}}-(x+3)= -5 \)

  The statement is false. It is possible to find two functions with non-existing limits so that the limit of their sum exists. We need to give a specific example.  Consider the functions: <br>

  There were no issues with Problem 1. In problem 2, we had to sketch neatly (use pencil and label the axes with arrows) like the one below, and then discuss the existence of limits. <br>
  
  \(\lim_{x\to a} f(x) \) exists for all values of \( a  \) and is equal to \( f(a) \)
  except when \( a=0 \). The limit does not exist at that point because the left and right sided limits are different. <br>

Following the AP exam, the general plan is to check-in at the start of class and have a 'study hall' option or participate in other ungraded activities. <br> In other words, there will not be any opportunities for grade improvement after the AP Exam. <br>
  As always, let me know if you have any questions.
