  Problem 1 generally went well. This was nearly identical to the question we did in class. For the cone, be sure to draw neatly and set of the ratio of similar triangles: <br>
  \( \frac{r}{3} = \frac{h}{10} \rightarrow r=\frac{3h}{10} \) <br>
  Substitute this into the volume formula so that the volume is in terms of \( h(t) \) only. <br>

  If you take the derivative implicitly with respect to time without substituting, be sure to use: <br>
  \( \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{3}{10} \frac{dh}{dt} \) <br>
  The unknown rate was: \( \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{8}{9\pi} cm/s \) <br>
  Be sure to include a sentence for the conclusion. 
 <br><br>
 P2. <br>
 Be sure to start with a correct drawing. If \( y \) is the length of the shadow and \( x \) is the distance from the spotlight, the ratio of similar triangles gives us: <br>
 \( \frac{ 12}{y} = \frac{x}{2} \) <br>
 Rewrite as: \( 24 = x(t) y(t) \) and then implicitly differentiate with respect to time \( t \)<br>
\( \frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{-3}{5} m/s \). Be sure to include a sentence for the conclusion.

  The equation of the curve is: \( x y + 2x-y=0 \) <br>
  Read the slope to the curve as: \( m=1/2 \) (the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line) <br>
  Differentiate completely: \( y + x \frac{dy}{dx} + 2 - \frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \) and plug in \( \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1}{2} \) to get: \( x=-2y-3 \) <br>
  Plug this back into the equation of the curve, and solve for: \(y = -1, y=-3 \) <br>
  Find the x-values, so that the points are: \( (-1, -1) \text{ and } (3, -3) \) <br>
  The normal line equations are: \( y+1 = -2 (x+1) \text{ and } y +3 = (-2)(x-3) \) <br>
  The graph below shows the curve, the given line, and the two tangent lines whose equations we found: <br>

  Setting y =0, we get: \( x= \pm \sqrt{7} \) (show work) <br />
  
  Differentiate implicitly: \( 2x + x \frac{dy}{dx} + y + 2 y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \), then solve: <br />
   \( \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{-2x-y}{x+2y} \) <br />
   
  Plug in each of \( (\pm\sqrt{7}, 0) \) to get \( \frac{dy}{dx} = -2 \) at both points.  <br>

  \( f(x) = \cot x + 2x \rightarrow f'(x) = -\csc^2x +2 \) <br>
  The slope of the tangent line at \( x= \pi/6  \) is \( f'(\pi/6) = -2. \) <br>
  This means that the slope of the normal line is \( 1/2 \). <br>
  Use \( f(\pi/6) = \sqrt{3} + \frac{\pi}{3} \) and the point slope formula to find the equation of the normal line: <br>
  \( y = \frac{x}{2} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{\pi}{4} \) <br><br>

  P2. <br>
  \( y = \tan x \rightarrow \frac{dy}{dx} = \sec^2 x  = 2 \). Give a reason why the slope has to equal 2: because we are looking for a tangent line that is parallel to the given line. <br>

  Solve the equation in the given domain, to find: \( x = \pm \frac{\pi}{4}  \). <br>
  Be sure to compute and include the y-coordinates in your answer: \( (\frac{-\pi}{4}, -1), (\frac{\pi}{4},1) \). <br><br>

  Use the quotient rule. Do NOT use techniques we have not discussed in class.  <br> 
  \( f(x) = \frac{2}{1-3x} \rightarrow f'(x) = \frac{(1-3x)*0 - (-3)*2}{(1-3x)^2} = \frac{6}{(1-3x)^2} \) <br>
  When \(x = 0, y = 2, f'(0) = 6 \rightarrow y = 6x + 2\) <br>
  When \(x = -1, y = \frac{1}{2}, f'(-1) = \frac{3}{8} \rightarrow y = \frac{3}{8}x + \frac{7}{8}\) <br> <br>

  P2.<br>
  The slope of the given line is \(-3 \), since the equation can be written as \( y = -3x \). <Br>

    Find the derivative using the power rule or the quotient rule:

    \( y = 12 x^{-1} \rightarrow \frac{dy}{dx} = -12 x^{-2} = \frac{-12}{x^2}  \) <br>
    Set the derivative equal to \( -3 \), then solve to find \( x= \pm 2 \). <br>
    The points are \( (2, 6) \) and \( (-2,-6) \). <bR><br>

  P1<br>
  \( f(x)=\frac{3}{1-x} \text{ at } x=-2 \) <br>
  
  Since the problem asks specifically to use the definition of slope as a number, be sure to either 
  use the "h" definition: \( m = \lim\limits_{h\to 0} \frac{f(-2+h)-f(-2)}{h} \) <br>
  
  or the "a" definition: \( \lim\limits_{x\to -2} \frac{f(x)-f(-2)}{x-(-2)}\). <br>
  
  Do NOT use the derivative as a function definition: \( f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \). <br>
  Be sure to show work for credit.<Br>
    
  \( \lim_{x\to -2} \frac{f(x)-f(-2)}{x - (-2)} = \lim_{x\to -2} \frac{\frac{3}{1-x} - \frac{3}{3}}{x+2} = \lim_{x\to -2}\frac{6+3x}{3(1-x)(x+2)} = ... = \frac{1}{3}  \)  <br>
  
  Use the point-slope or slope-intercept form to find the equation of the tangent line: \( y = \frac{x+5}{3} \) <br>

  <b> October 1, 2024 | Quiz feedback </b> <br>

  a) Be sure to use limits when discussing continuity: <br>

  At \( x = 2 \) the graph of \(g \) is continuous from both sides, since \( \lim\limits_{x\to 2^-} g(x) = \lim\limits_{x\to 2^+} g(x) = 0 = g(2)  \). Therefore the graph of \( g(x) \) is continuous at \(x = 2\). <br> 
  At \( x = 3 \) the graph of \(g \) is continuous from both sides, since \( \lim\limits_{x\to 3^-} g(x) = \lim\limits_{x\to 3^+} g(x) = -1 = g(3)  \). Therefore the graph of \( g(x) \) is continuous at \(x = 3 \). <br> 
  At \( x = 4 \) the graph of \(g \) is only continuous from the right , since \( \lim\limits_{x\to 4^+} g(x) = \pi = g(4)  \). \( g(x) \) is not continuous from the left at \(x = 4 \) because \( \lim\limits_{x\to 4^-} g(x) = 0 \neq g(4) = \pi \). <br>

  Be sure to use arrows or explain your thinking in words. Be careful about plugging in right away! <Br>
  a) <br>
  \( \lim\limits_{t\to \pi/2^+} e^{\tan t} = e^{ \lim\limits_{t\to \pi/2^+} \tan t} =  0  \) because \( \tan(t) \rightarrow - \infty \) and raising e to an infinitely small number tends towards zero.<br> <Br>
  
  b) <br>
  \( \lim\limits_{\theta \to 0}\tan(\frac{1-\cos\theta}{\theta}) = \tan(\lim\limits_{\theta \to 0}\frac{1-\cos\theta}{\theta} ) = \tan(0) = 0 \) <br>
  Note that the inner limit is that famous limit we talked about in class. <br> <br>
  
  c) <br>
  Use the log properties here instead of subtracting infinities. <br> 
  \(\lim\limits_{\theta\to 0^+} \ln(\sin(2\theta)) - \ln(\tan(\theta)) =\lim\limits_{\theta\to 0^+} \ln( \frac{ \sin(2\theta)}{\tan(\theta)}) = ... = \ln 2 \) <br> <br>
  
  P2. <br>
  
  Let \( f(x) = x+\sin x + -1  \). This function is continuous on the interval \( [0, \pi/6] \), so we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem: <br>
  
  \( f(0) = -1 < 0 \) <Br>
  \( f(\pi/6) = \frac{\pi-3}{6} > 0 \) <br>
  
  Therefore, since the the sign changes from negative to positive and the graph of f(x) is continuous on the given interval, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, the function has at least one x-intercept in the given interval, which is the same as saying that the equation has at least one root on the given interval.

  Be sure to Justify! <br><br>

  a) <br>
  \( \lim\limits_{x\to -2}\frac{2-|x|}{2+x} = \lim\limits_{x\to -2}\frac{2-(-x)}{2+x} = \lim\limits_{x\to -2}\frac{2+x}{2+x}  \) <br>
  -Because x is going to -2 and hence is less than zero, \( |x| = -x \) for both one-sided limits. <br>
  -The overall limit comes out to 1, after confirming both sides. <br><br>
  b) <br>
  \( \lim\limits_{x \to 0.5^{-}}\frac{2x-1}{x^2 |2x-1|} \) <br>
  Be sure to state that since \( x < 0.5 \), it follows that \( 2x-1 < 0 \), therefore \( |2x-1|  = -(2x-1) \). <br>
  -The one sided limit, with work, comes out to -4 <br> <br>

  Be sure to remember the chain rule when finding the derivative. <br> 

  Factor before separating variables: <br>
  \( \int e^{-y} dy = \int (x+2) dx \) <br>

  \( -e^{-y} = \frac{x^2}{2} + 2x + C \leftarrow (0, 0) \) <br>
 \( C = -1  \), therefore: \( -e^{-y} = \frac{x^2}{2} + 2x - 1 \) <br>
 Multiply both sides by -1, to get: <br>
 \( e^{-y} = 1- 2x - \frac{x^2}{2} \) <br>
 Take the natural log: <br>
 \( -y = \ln | 1 - 2x - \frac{x^2}{2}| \) <br>
 Multiply by (-1) <br>
 
 \( y = = - \ln | 1 - 2x - \frac{x^2}{2}| \) <br>
 Optionally, you can also write the solution as: <br>
 \( y = \ln |\frac{1}{1-2x-\frac{x^2}{2}}| =\ln |\frac{2}{2-4x-x^2}| \)

  Be sure to remember the chain rule when finding the derivative. <br> 

  \( f(x) = (\frac{x}{2})^4 + \frac{1}{2x^2} \rightarrow f'(x) = \frac{x^3}{4}-\frac{1}{x^3} \) <br>

  \( (dy/dx)^2 + 1 = \frac{x^6}{16} - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{x^6} + 1 = \frac{x^6}{16} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{x^6} = (\frac{x^3}{4}+\frac{1}{x^3})^2  \) <br>
  <br>

  \( L = \int_1^4 \sqrt{(dy/dx)^2 + 1} dx =  \int_1^4 \frac{x^3}{4}+\frac{1}{x^3} dx = ... = \frac{525}{32} \)

 a) \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n (n+1)3^n}{ 2^{2n+1}} \) <br>
 The Ratio Test works best here. Be sure to use the absolute value notation: <br>

 \( |\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| = |\frac{(n+2)3^{n+1}}{2^{2n+3}} * \frac{2^{2n+1}}{(n+1)3^n}| = ... |\frac{n+2}{n+1} \frac{3}{4}|\rightarrow \frac{3}{4} < 1 \) <br>
 Since the series converges absolutely, it convergs. <br> <br>

 b) \( \sum_{n=1} (-1)^n \frac{\sqrt{n}}{2n+1} \) <br>
 Use the alternating series test  here. We need to check and show work for two conditions: <br>
 First, \( b_n = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{2n+1} = \frac{1/\sqrt{n}}{2+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}} \rightarrow \frac{0}{2+0} = 0 \) <br>
 Second, confirm that \( b_{n+1} \leq b_n\). You can do this algebraically or by taking the derivative of \( f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{2x+1}\) and confirming that the derivative is negative. <br>

 c) \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\cos 3n}{1+(1.2)^n} \) <br>
 This is similar to the example from class. We show absolute convergence for the given series by using the comparison test twice: <br>
 \( | \frac{\cos 3n}{1+(1.2)^n} | \leq \frac{1}{1+(1.2)^n} < \frac{1}{(1.2)^n} = (5/6)^n \) <br>
 The right-most sequence above makes a geometric series that is convergent, so by the Comparison Test, the original series converges absolutely, and therefore it converges. <br>

 d) \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-5)^{2n}}{n^2 9^n} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{5^{2n}}{n^2 9^n}  \) <br>
 Use the ratio test with care to show that the series diverges. Note that: \( a_{n+1} = \frac{5^{2(n+1)}}{(n+1)^2 9^{n+1} }\). The ratio ends up approaching 25/9, which is greater than 1. <br>

  <b> April 4, 2024 | Thoughts on problem 15 from today's worksheet.</b> <br>
 
  An odd number can be described as \( 2n-1 \) or \( 2n+1 \) if n is a positive integer. <br> 
   In the absence of a formula for the product of the odd numbers, we write: <br>
   \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1*3*...*(2n-1)}{n!} \) <br>
   Proceed to test using the Ratio Test:
   \( |\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| = | \frac{1*3*...*(2n-1)(2n+1)}{(n+1)*n!} \frac{n!}{1*3*...*(2n-1)}| = |\frac{2n+1}{n+1}|\rightarrow 2 > 1  \) <br>
   Therefore the series diverges.

  a) True. All sequences are functions because for every n in the domain there is exactly one term of the sequence. <br>
  b) False. Consider \( a_n=(-1)^n, b_n = (-1)^{n+1} \). The sequence \( \{a_n + b_n\} \) converges to 0 even though the individual sequences diverge. <br>
  c) False. Consider \( \{(-1)^n \}_{n=1}^{\infty} \). <br>
  d) True. The y-value of the horizontal asymptote is also where the sequences converges. <br> <br>

  P2.<br>
  a) This is geometric sequence with \( r=\frac{\pi}{4} \). Since \( -1 < r  \leq 1 \), the sequence converges. In this case it converges to 0. <br>
  b) The positive part of the sequence converges to 2. Therefore the sequences oscillates between approximately 2 and approximately -2. The sequence therefore diverges. <br>
  c) The natural log goes to infinity. The outer function (arctangent) goes towards \( \pi/2 \), therefore the sequence converges to \( \pi/2 \). <br>

  Be sure to draw a right triangle. Use trig substitution: \( x = a\sin\theta \rightarrow dx = a\cos\theta d\theta \).<br>
  When \( x = -a \rightarrow \theta = -\pi/2\). When \( x=a \rightarrow \theta = \pi/2 \).
  Be sure to update the bounds of integration whenever you switch variables: <Br>
  \( A = \int_{-a}^a \sqrt{a^2-x^2} dx = ... = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} a^2 \cos^2\theta d\theta = a^2 \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \frac{\cos(2\theta)+1}{2} d\theta = ... = \frac{\pi a^2}{2}  \) <br>

  \( A=1/12, B = -1/12, C=-1/3 \) <br>
  \( \int \frac{1}{x^3-8} dx = \frac{1}{12} \ln|x-2| - \frac{1}{4\sqrt{3}} \arctan(\frac{x+1}{\sqrt{3}}) -\frac{1}{24}\ln(x^2+2x+4) + C \)

  The function is positive on the given interval, so the definite integral is the same as area, even if we don't know the shape of the curve. <br>

Use trigonometric substitution: <br> 
\( x = \sec \theta \rightarrow dx = \sec \theta \tan \theta d\theta; x^2 = \sec^2 \theta \) <br>

\( \int_3^5 \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{x^2-1}} dx = \int_a^b \frac{\sec^2\theta}{\tan\theta} \sec \theta \tan \theta d\theta   \) <br>
where: \( a =\arccos(1/3), b =\arccos(1/5)  \) <br>

  Note that the term extrema is the plural of extremum. Since the problem asks about the global extrema, we need to check for both max and min. <br>
  First, we state that the function is continuous on the given interval, which means we can use the Closed Interval Method: <br>
  Find and factor the first derivative completely: \(f'(x)=x^2 e^{-2x} (3-2x) \) <br>
  Find two critical numbers: 0, 3/2. Only 3/2 is in the given interval from 1 to 4, so we ignore 0. <br>
  Evaluate the function at the endpoints and at the critical number: <br>
  \( f(1)=\frac{1}{e^2} \\ f(3/2) =\frac{27}{8e^3} \\ f(4)=\frac{64}{e^8} \) <br>
  
  Compare these three values by rewriting each fraction with a common denominator: <br>
  \( f(1)=\frac{8e^6}{8e^8} \\ f(3/2) =\frac{27 e^5}{8e^8} \\ f(4) = \frac{8*64}{8e^8} \) <br>
  Absolute maximum: \( (\frac{3}{2}, \frac{27}{8e^3}) \) <br>
  Absolute minimum: \( (4, \frac{64}{e^8}) \) <br><br>

  Suppose the tangent line touches the curve at \( x = a  \) <br>
  Find slope after evaluating the derivative: \( f'(x)=3e^{3x} \rightarrow f'(a) = 3e^{3a} \) <br>
  The slope is also equal to the slope of the segment connecting the origin to the point on the curve: \( \frac{e^{3a}-0}{a-0} = \frac{e^3a}{a} \) <br>
  Set the two versions of slope equal to each other, and then solve to find: \( a=\frac{1}{3} \) <br>
  The point on the curve is: \( (\frac{1}{3}, e) \). <br><br>
    
  P2. <br>
  \( L(x) = f(\pi/3) + f'(\pi/3) (x-\pi/3) \rightarrow L(x) = \sqrt{3} + 4(x-\pi/3) \)<br>
  Plugging in \( x = 61\pi/180 \), we get:
  \( \tan(61^{\circ}) \approxeq L(61\pi/180) = \sqrt{3} + \pi/45 \) 
  <br><br>
  
  P3.<br>
  Draw a right triangle with hypotenuse \( c \) and legs \( a, b \). <br>
  We know that: \( \frac{dc}{dt} = m, \frac{da}{dt} = -n \) <br>
  Let \( \alpha \) be the angle formed by \( c \) and \( b \). <br>
  For part a) rewrite the relationship: \( \sin\alpha = \frac{a}{c} \) as \( \alpha = \arcsin(\frac{a(t)}{c(t)}) \) <br>
  For part b)  differentiate with respect to time: \( \frac{d\alpha}{dt} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{a^2}{c^2}}} \frac{c*da/dt - a*dc/dt}{c^2} \) <br>
  Plug in the known rates as well as \( c = \sqrt{2} \) to find \( \frac{d\alpha}{dt} = -n-\frac{m}{\sqrt{2}} \) radians per second. <br>
  At the instant when both legs are 1 centimeter, the angle \( \alpha \) formed by the hypotenuse and side \( b \) decreases at a rate of \( n+ \frac{m}{\sqrt{2}} \) radians per second.

  \( dy/dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{x^2}{4}}}\frac{1}{2} \) by the chain rule. <br>
  Evaluate at the origin to get \( f'(0)=1/2 \) <br>
  The tangent line equation is \( y= x/2 \) <br>
  
  P2. <br>
  Use logarithmic differentiation to find \( m = 3 \) and the tangent line equation is \( y=3x. \) <br>
  The first steps are below: <br>
  
  \( y = \frac{x (\sqrt[3]{x}+1)^2}{\sqrt{x+1}} \) <br>
  \( \ln y = \ln x + 2 \ln(\sqrt[3]{x}+1) -\frac{1}{2} \ln(x+1) \)<br>
  
  \( \frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{\sqrt[3]{x}+1} \frac{1}{3}*x^{-2/3} -\frac{1}{2(x+1)} \)

  Draw a circle with radius r. Set up the area equation: \( A(t) =\pi (r(t))^2 \) <br>
  Differentiate with respect to time: \( dA/dt = 2 \pi r \frac{dr}{dt} \) <br>
  Plug in to find find: \( \frac{dA}{dt} = 100.8\pi \frac{ft^2}{min} \) <br>
  Conclusion: When the radius of the oil slick is 120 ft, its area is increasing at a rate of \( 100.8\pi ft^2/min\). <br><br>

  Make a drawing of a straight shoreline and a point R (radar) 6 km away from the nearest point B on the shore. <br>
  Label a point down the shore as point A, and call AB = x. The angle ARB is \( \theta \). The moment we are interested in is when the angle BAR is 45 degrees, which means the angle ARB is also 45 degrees.<br>
  We know that \( \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{2\pi}{5} rad/s \) <br />
  With this set up, the equation is: \( \tan\theta = \frac{x}{6} \) or if you prefer, \( \theta = \arctan(x/6) \) <br><br>

  Differentiate both sides with respect to time, to find \( dx/dt = \frac{24\pi}{5} \frac{km}{s} \) <br>
  Conclusion: When the beam makes a 45 degree angle with the shore, the radar beam is moving at a rate of \( \frac{24\pi}{5} \frac{km}{s}\). <br><br>
