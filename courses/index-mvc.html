Write out the normal vector of the plane: \( \vec{n} = < \sqrt{3},1, 0 > \) <br>
Write out the derivative of the given curve: \( \vec{r'(t)} = <-2\sin t, 2\cos t, e^t> \) <br>
The derivative of the curve at some point has to be perpendicular to the normal vector to the plane in order for the tangent line to parallel, so we set the dot product equal to zero: <br>

\( \vec{r'(t^*)} \cdot \vec{n} = 0 \rightarrow -2\sqrt{3}\sin t + 2\cos t = 0 \rightarrow \tan t = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \rightarrow t=\frac{\pi}{6}  \) <br>
The corresponding point is \( (\sqrt{3}, 1, e^{\pi/6}) \)
<br><br>
P2.<br>
To parametrize the intersection, set \( x(t) = t \). From the first surface we get \( y=\sqrt{25-t^2}\). <br>
From the second surface we get: \( z = \sqrt{20-(25-t^2)} = \sqrt{t^2-5}\) <br>
Therefore, a parametric equation of the intersection between the surfaces is \( \vec{r(t)} = < t,\sqrt{25-t^2} , \sqrt{t^2-5}>\)
At the given point, we know that \( x = t = 3 \), so we find the direction vector of the tangent line by evaluating: <br>
\( \vec{r'(t)} = < 1, \frac{-t}{\sqrt{25-t^2}},\frac{t}{\sqrt{t^2-5}} > \) at \( t = 3\). <br>
The direction vector is \( \vec{r'(3)} = < 1, \frac{-3}{4}, \frac{3}{2} >\) or we can also use its multiple: \( <4, -3, 6> \) <br>
The vector equation of the tangent line is: \( <3,4,2> + t*<4,-3,6>\). <br>
Feel free to plot in SageMath, by the way, the original curve and the tangent line. You could even include the original surfaces. <br><br>

a) The curve is an ellipse on the yz plane, centered at the origin and with equation: \( \frac{y^2}{4} + \frac{z^2}{9} = 1\). The major axis is 6 and the minor axis is 4 units. <br>
b) Find \( | \vec{r'}(t) | = \sqrt{4\sin^2t+9\cos^2t} \). The least value occurs when cosine is zero, which means sine is 1 or -1, therefore the minimum is 2. <br>
The largest value occurs when sine is 0, which means cosine is 1 or -1, so the largest value is 3. <br>
Similar reasoning for the length of the second derivative leads to the same conclusion: the minimum value is 2 and the maximum is 3. <br>
<hr>
<b> October 24, 2024 | Notes on Problem 48 | Section 11.7  </b> <br>
If we let \( u = x^2, v = y^2 \), we get: \( 2u + 2v + (u+v)^2 = 3 \). <br>
Rewrite as: \( (u + v )^2 + 2 (u+v) + 1 = 4  \) <br>
Rewrite as: \( (u+v+1)^2 = 4 \), which is the same as \( u + v = 1\) or \( x^2 + y^2 = 1\). <br>
Hence the shape is a circle.

  Let the points be: A(1, 2), B(3,1), and C(8,4). Form three vectors: <br>
  \( \vec{AB} = < 2, -1 >, \vec{BC} = < 5, 3 >, \vec{AC} = < 7, 2> \) <br>
  Find the three possibilities by adding any vector to the point that wasn't used to form that vector. For example, to the vector \( \vec{OC} \) we add the vector \( \vec{AB} \).

  There were no issues with problem 2, except be sure to use vectors: <br>

  If the points of trisection are M and N and the vector connecting the two given points is \( \vec{AB} = < 6, 3 > \), then: <br>

  \( \vec{OM} = \vec{OA} + \frac{1}{3}\vec{AB} = <3, 3 > \) <br>

Similarly:

\( \vec{ON} = \vec{OA} + \frac{2}{3}\vec{AB} = <5, 4 > \) <br>

Form three vectors using the points: A(4, -2, 7), B(-2,0,3), C(7, -3, 9). <br>

\( \vec{AB} = < -6, 2, -4 >,  \vec{AC} = < 3, -1, 2 >, \vec{BC} = < 9, -3, 6 > \) <br>

Note that \( \vec{AB} = -2* \vec{AC} \text{ and } \vec{BC} = (-3/2)* \vec{AB} \) <br>

\( t\vec{v}  \) consists of all points on the line in the direction of vector  \( \vec{v} \), passing through the origin. <br>

\( \vec{u} + t\vec{v} \) describes all points on the lines that passes through the tip of \( \vec{u} \) in the direction of \( \vec{v} \). Here we assume that vector \( \vec{u} \) starts at the origin. <Br> 
	
\( s\vec{u} + t\vec{v} \) describes all points on the plane as long as \( \vec{u}, \vec{v} \) are not parallel to each other. If they are parallel, the resulting set is the line passing through the origin in the direction of either vector.

Question:  Find \(a \) such that the volume inside the hemisphere \( z=\sqrt{16-x^2-y^2}\) and outside the cylinder \( x^2 + y^2 = a^2 \) is one-half the volume of the hemisphere. <br><br>

Draw the region between the cocentric circles with radii \(a \) and 4, for \( 0 < a < 4\). <br>
The integral becomes: \( \int_0^{2\pi} \int_a^4 \sqrt{(16-r^2)} r dr d\theta = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{2} \frac{4\pi 4^3}{3} = \frac{64\pi}{3} \) <br>
\( \int_0^{2\pi} \int_a^4 \sqrt{(16-r^2)} r dr d\theta = \frac{-1}{2} \int_0^{2\pi} \int_a^4 \sqrt{(16-r^2)} (-2r) dr d\theta = ... = \int_0^{2\pi}\frac{1}{3} (16-a^2)^{3/2} d\theta =\frac{2\pi}{3} (16-a^2)^{3/2}   \)
<br>

\(\frac{2\pi}{3} (16-a^2)^{3/2} = \frac{64\pi}{3} \rightarrow (16-a^2)^{3/2} = 32 \rightarrow 16-a^2 = 32^{2/3} \rightarrow a^2 = 16 - 8\sqrt[3]{2} \rightarrow a = \sqrt{16 - 8\sqrt[3]{2}}= 2 \sqrt{4 - 2\sqrt[3]{2}} \)
<hr>
  <b> April 30, 2024 | Notes on improper double integral </b> <br>
The original form of the integral is improper because the upper bound goes to infinity but also because the integrand is not continuous at the lower bound (x=0). <br> 
Therefore, if we approach this as a single-variable problem, we need to break up the integral into two adjacent integrals and investigate each separately:  <br>

\( \int_0^{\infty}\frac{e^{-x} - e^{-2x}}{x} dx = \int_0^1 f(x) dx + \int_1^{\infty} f(x) dx  \) <br>  <Br>
  If we use the author's hint: <br>
  \( \int_0^t \int_1^2 e^{-xy} dy dx = \int_1^2 \int_0^t e^{-xy} dx dy = ... = \int_1^2 \frac{-e^{-ty}}{y} +\frac{1}{y} dy = \) <br>
  \( = \ln 2 - \int_1^2 \frac{e^{-ty}}{y} dy\) <br>
  The integral expression converges to 0 by the ratio test. We can numerically approximate for large values of t. <br>
  <hr>
  <b> April 22, 2024 | Notes on problem 43 (14.1) </b> <br>
  The function is not continuous at (0,0) so the results below are not surprising. Fubini's Theorem does not apply here due to the discontinuity. 
  Because of the behavior of the integrand especially near the bottom left corner, our numerical approximations using Java also should not be surprising, even if we start slightly away from (0, 0).
  The integrand, for example, approaches negative infinity as we approach the origin along the x-axis. Some code: <br>

  <pre>
    <code class=""language-python">
      x, y = var('x y')
      #try this:

Set this up as a two-constraint problem. Be sure to label the equations: <br>
\( (0) f(x,y,z) = z\)  (the objective function) <br>
\( (4) g(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2-z^2 = 0 \) (the cone constraint) <br>
\( (5) h(x,y,z) = x+2z = 4 \) (the plane constraint) <br><br>

The multipliers conditions: <br>
\( (1) 0 = \lambda (2x) + \mu * 1 \)  <br>
\( (2) 0 = \lambda (2y) + \mu * 0 \) <br>
\( (3) 1 = \lambda (-2z) +\mu * 2 \) <br><br>

In problem 1, find the derivative of the vector-valued function: <br>
\( \vec{r'(t)} = < -2\sin t, 2\cos t, e^t > \) <br />
Read the normal vector to the plane: \( \vec{n} = < \sqrt{3}, 1, 0 > \) <br> 
Set the dot product of the two vector expressions above equal to zero, to find: <br>
\( \tan t = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \rightarrow t = \frac{\pi}{6} \) <br>

The wanted point is \( (\sqrt{3}, 1, e^{\pi/6}) \) <br><br>

P2 <br>
To parametrize the intersection, we can simply set \( x=t \) or look for an option that uses trigonometric functions. <br>
with the first option, we get: \( \vec{r(t)} = < t, \sqrt{25-t^2}, \sqrt{t^2-5} > \) <br>
Find the derivative and then evaluate at t=3, to get: \( \vec{r'(3)} = < 1, -3/4, 3/2 > \) <br>

The vector equation of the tangent line is: \( < x, y, z > = < 3+t, 4-3t/4, 2+3t/2 > \) <br> <br>

Alternatively, for a trig parametrization, we start with the second equation and set: <br>
\( y=\sqrt{20} \cos t, z=\sqrt{20}\sin t \), the first component becomes: \( x=\sqrt{25-20\cos^2t} \) <br>
Finding the specific t value isn't necessary with this approach, because with the coordinates (3,4,2), we get: \( \cos t = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, \sin t=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), <br>
which can be plugged into the derivative's components directly, without using the inverse. <br>
\( x'(t^{*}) = 8/3, y'(t^{*})=-2, x'(t^{*})=4  \) <br>
Note the this direction vector is a multiple of the one we found with the first approach.

P1 <br>
Let point P have coordinates \( (x, y, z)  \). Translating the condition about distance into an equation, we get: <br />

\( |y-1| = 2 \sqrt{x^2+(y+1)^2 + z^2} \) <br />
Square both sides, to get: <br>
\( y^2-2y + 1 = 4x^2 + 4z^2 + 4y^2+8y+4 \)  <br />
\( 4x^2 + 3y^2 + 10y + 4z^2 = -3 \) <br />
Complete the square for all three variables:  <br /> 
\( 4x^2 + 3(y^2 + 2*5y/3 + 25/9) + 4z^2 = -3 + 3*25/9 = 16/3 \) <br />
\( \frac{x^2}{4/3} + \frac{(y+5/3)^2}{16/9} + \frac{z^2}{4/3} = 1 \) <br />

The points P describe an ellipsoid centered at (0, -5/3, 0). <br /> <br />

P2 <br>
Surface 1: \( x^2 + 2y^2-z^2 + 3x = 1 \) <br>
Surface 2: \( 2x^2 + 4y^2-2z^2 - 5y = 0 \) <br>

The intersection of the two surfaces consists of points (x, y, z) that satisfy both equations. <br>
Note that if we multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract side by side, we get: \( 6x + 5y = 2 \). <br/>
This means that the intersection of the two surfaces, no matter what it looks like, must consist of points that belong to a plane. <br> <br>
