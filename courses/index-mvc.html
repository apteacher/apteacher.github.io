<b> November 9, 2023 | Notes on Recent Quiz </b> <br>

P1 <br>
a) <br>
The curve is an ellipse centered at the origin and the equation is: <br>
\( \frac{y^2}{4} + \frac{z^2}{9} = 1 \) <br>
The major (z-direction) and minor (x-direction) axes are 9 and 4, respectively. <br>
b) <br>
  \( \vec{r'(t)} = <-2 \sin(t), 3 \cos(t)> , \vec{r''(t)} = <-2 \cos(t), -3 \sin(t)> \) <br>
  \( |\vec{r'(t)}| = \sqrt{4 + 5\cos^2 t} \), so the minimum and maximum are 2 and 3. Those occur when cosine is 0 and 1, respectively. <br>
  \( |\vec{r''(t)}| = \sqrt{4 + 5\sin^2 t} \), so the minimum and maximum are 2 and 3. Those occur when sine is 0 and 1, respectively. <br>
P2 <br>
a)  Use integration by parts twice. This was the messiest of the three. <br>
Final answer: \( < \frac{-(\cos(t)+\sin(t))}{2 e^t},\frac{\sin(t)-\cos(t)}{2 e^t}> + \vec{C} \) <br>
b) Final answer: \( < \sqrt{2}-1, \frac{\ln 2}{2}, \frac{1}{2} > \) <br>
c) Final answer: \( < e^{2t} \frac{2t-1}{4}, -t -\ln(1-t), \arcsin t > + \vec{C} \) <br><br>
<hr>
<b> November 7, 2023 | Notes on Recent Quiz </b> <br>

P1 <br>
In problem 1, find the derivative of the vector-valued function: <br>
\( \vec{r'(t)} = < -2\sin t, 2\cos t, e^t > \) <br />
Read the normal vector to the plane: \( \vec{n} = < \sqrt{3}, 1, 0 > \) <br> 
Set the dot product of the two vector expressions above equal to zero, to find: <br>
\( \tan t = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \rightarrow t = \frac{\pi}{6} \) <br>

The wanted point is \( (\sqrt{3}, 1, e^{\pi/6}) \) <br><br>

P2 <br>
To parametrize the intersection, we can simply set \( x=t \) or look for an option that uses trigonometric functions. <br>
with the first option, we get: \( \vec{r(t)} = < t, \sqrt{25-t^2}, \sqrt{t^2-5} > \) <br>
Find the derivative and then evaluate at t=3, to get: \( \vec{r'(3)} = < 1, -3/4, 3/2 > \) <br>

The vector equation of the tangent line is: \( < x, y, z > = < 3+t, 4-3t/4, 2+3t/2 > \) <br> <br>

Alternatively, for a trig parametrization, we start with the second equation and set: <br>
\( y=\sqrt{20} \cos t, z=\sqrt{20}\sin t \), the first component becomes: \( x=\sqrt{25-20\cos^2t} \) <br>
Finding the specific t value isn't necessary with this approach, because with the coordinates (3,4,2), we get: \( \cos t = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, \sin t=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), <br>
which can be plugged into the derivative's components directly, without using the inverse. <br>
\( x'(t^{*}) = 8/3, y'(t^{*})=-2, x'(t^{*})=4  \) <br>
Note the this direction vector is a multiple of the one we found with the first approach.

P1 <br>
Let point P have coordinates \( (x, y, z)  \). Translating the condition about distance into an equation, we get: <br />

\( |y-1| = 2 \sqrt{x^2+(y+1)^2 + z^2} \) <br />
Square both sides, to get: <br>
\( y^2-2y + 1 = 4x^2 + 4z^2 + 4y^2+8y+4 \)  <br />
\( 4x^2 + 3y^2 + 10y + 4z^2 = -3 \) <br />
Complete the square for all three variables:  <br /> 
\( 4x^2 + 3(y^2 + 2*5y/3 + 25/9) + 4z^2 = -3 + 3*25/9 = 16/3 \) <br />
\( \frac{x^2}{4/3} + \frac{(y+5/3)^2}{16/9} + \frac{z^2}{4/3} = 1 \) <br />

The points P describe an ellipsoid centered at (0, -5/3, 0). <br /> <br />

P2 <br>
Surface 1: \( x^2 + 2y^2-z^2 + 3x = 1 \) <br>
Surface 2: \( 2x^2 + 4y^2-2z^2 - 5y = 0 \) <br>

The intersection of the two surfaces consists of points (x, y, z) that satisfy both equations. <br>
Note that if we multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract side by side, we get: \( 6x + 5y = 2 \). <br/>
This means that the intersection of the two surfaces, no matter what it looks like, must consist of points that belong to a plane. <br> <br>

P1 <br>
Let the points be: A(1, 2), B(3,1), and C(8,4). Form three vectors: <br>
\( \vec{AB} = < 2, -1 >, \vec{BC} = < 5, 3 >, \vec{AC} = < 7, 2> \) <br>
Find the three possibilities by adding any vector to the point that wasn't used to form that vector. For example, to the vector \( \vec{OC} \) we add the vector \( \vec{AB} \).

The missing points are: (10, 3), (-4, -1), and (6, 5), as shown below: <br>

<b> September 14, 2023 | Quiz Notes </b> <br>
Below find some quiz notes. Graded work will be returned in class. If there are mistakes or typos below, feel free to email me. <br>

P1 <br>
Form three vectors using the points: A(4, -2, 7), B(-2,0,3), C(7, -3, 9). <br>

\( \vec{AB} = < -6, 2, -4 >,  \vec{AC} = < 3, -1, 2 >, \vec{BC} = < 9, -3, 6 > \) <br>

Note that \( \vec{AB} = -2* \vec{AC} \text{ and } \vec{BC} = (-3/2)* \vec{AB} \) <br>

The three vectors are therefore multiples of each other, so the points are collinear.  <Br>

Note that the problem asked us to use vectors. <br> <br>
	
P2<br>
A(2, 9, 1), B(3,11,4), C(0, 10, 12), D(1, 12, 5) <Br>
	
Same idea here, except the four resulting vectors should be two equal pairs: <br>
\( \vec{AB} = < 1, 2, 3 > = \vec{CD} \text{ and } \vec{AC} = < -2, 1, 1 > = \vec{BD}  \)  <br>
Note that the problem asked us to use vectors. <br> <br>

P3 <Br>

\( t\vec{v}  \) consists of all points on the line in the direction of vector  \( \vec{v} \), passing through the origin. <br>

\( \vec{u} + t\vec{v} \) describes all points on the lines that passes through the tip of \( \vec{u} \) in the direction of \( \vec{v} \). Here we assume that vector \( \vec{u} \) starts at the origin. <Br> 
	
\( s\vec{u} + t\vec{v} \) describes all points on the plane as long as \( \vec{u}, \vec{v} \) are not parallel to each other. If they are parallel, the resulting set is the line passing through the origin in the direction of either vector.

<b> December 9, 2022 | About the final exam </b> <br>
The exam will be comprehensive of all fall semester material and it will carry a weight of 20% towards the overall grade. Your quiz average, which is your current grade in the course, will carry a weight of 80%. <br>
To prepare for the exam, go over previous homework assignments and assessments. The assignments should still be accessible on myCushing by visiting the Assignments tab on your course page. The exam will last a minimum of 90 minutes and a maximum of 120 minutes. The format of the exam will likely be similar to the one for quizzes but there may be some multiple choice questions as well. Calculators may or may not be required so be sure to bring them. On the day of the exam, you should bring your own utensils.The exam is scheduled for Tuesday morning, December 13, 8:30am.   <br>


Optional Extra Help Sessions: Monday (2:30pm-3:30pm in JRCAC 110;  8:15pm-9:15pm via Zoom <a href="https://cushingacademy.zoom.us/j/294640299?pwd=UVIxdXhlZ0t4UU9OTWx3ZTFFaXBwUT09

<b> November 15, 2022 | Comment on Section 12.3 | Problem 26?</b> <br>
We used the double angle formula quite a bit in the last few days. For integrals of the form: <br>
\( \int \sin x \cos x \text{ } dx \) <br> we can also use simple u-substitution: <br> \( u=\sin x \) or \( u = \cos x\) <br>
In problem 26, integrating this way will give us a more direct way to convert from the given parameter t to arclength s, because you will have an expression for \( \sin t \), and for \(\cos t \) we can use \( \cos t = \sqrt{1-\sin^2 t} \) <br>

We can discuss this further in class if necessary.

The 'current_grade' assignment is not really an assignment but just a way to keep you informed about your present average. For example, as of Saturday, September 17, what you see on myCushing is current. <br>
