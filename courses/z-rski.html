<h3> Important Tips and Reminders: </h3>

<b>Helmets:</b> are required. No excuses. The Athletics department will be inspecting each helmet.  <br><br>
<b>Lessons: required for beginners.</b> If he hasn't, Mr. Suchanek will confirm the time for lessons. In the past, lessons have taken place on Wednesdays (2pm-3pm).<br><br>
<b>Day students:</b> If your parents are picking you up from the mountain, please communicate with one of the faculty chaperones.<br><br>
<b>Bus Rides:</b> Ride the same vehicle to and from the mountain. Use headphones for entertainment (no speakers!). Do not leave trash on the bus. <br><br>
<b>Tardiness:</b> A minimum of 3 infraction points will be recorded for unexcused tardiness at the mountain. If you are renting, allow enough time to return the equipment. If tardiness becomes a concern, we may make our stay at the mountain shorter.<br><br>
<b>Safety Check-ins:</b> The school expects you to check-in once during your stay at the mountain, Monday through Thursday. If you are taking a lesson you do not need to check-in. The check-in times are listed in the timetable.<br><br>
<b>Storage at the mountain:</b> use the storage bins in the lodge. Make sure any expensive items are not visible or do not bring with you to the mountain. For a fee, you can also rent a locker at the mountain.<br><br>
<b>Storage on campus:</b> In the past, the Athletics Department has provided lockers in Heslin. Ask Mr. Suchanek if you are interested.<br>
